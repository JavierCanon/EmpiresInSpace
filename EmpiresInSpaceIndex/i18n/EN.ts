    tabDescription:/* "During the last years, I was looking for a browser equivalent of the classic computer space strategy games, only that it should be for an open ended amount of players. Since nothing exists which should really be named 'Strategy' game, I try to fill that gap.<br>" +
    "These are the key features<br>"+
    "A 2D map on which Ships are moved, which has to be explored and where you find suitable colonies. Look and Feel should be like in an installed game.<br>"+
    "The game can be lost.This is the only way to make conflicts really tense. Build up your colonies and Fleets, and always know that a declaration of war might end all that.Since ressources are sparse, there will be some fight (but good diplomats could win the game without a single shot).<br>" +
    "Trade gets you ressources which do not exists in the area where you are settled.<br>"+
    "The game is round based, and should not conflict with work or school. There are benefits for hardcore gamers, but player who just want to look once per day after their colonies and create new trades might just do that. Nightly declarations of war and a subsequent blitzkrieg against you are not possible, you will always have at least one full day to react.<br> "+
    "The game will end after 9 to 12 months with one or the other winning condition. New games are starting every three months, so if you have bad luck and are prematurely removed from a game, there will be another one that just started or one that will start very soon.<br> " ,

    "Colonize a world, explore the surronding space and expand your sphere of influence, research new technologies, negotiate with other players about treaties or fight them, trade goods with other players and much more...<p>" +

    tabPay2Win : '<p>I do not want to display commercials, and i do not like "pay to win" games. To be able to work full time on the project and to pay for the webhosting, I decided to use the following system:<br>' +
    'I host multiple parallel games. Each game has either a capped tech tree, or the full tech tree. If the tech tree is capped, this affects <b> all </b> players of that game.<br>' +
    'Users who play for free can join capped games and play them.Since the cap does affect all members of that game, it will be fair. And since most of the fun comes from the multiplayer aspect, the cap does not hurt much.<br>' + 
                    'Users which pay a small amount (12 $ for one year) get access to noncapped games.They can continue to play capped games, but the restriction remains in these.<br>' +
    "Aside from the cool high tech features such as star gates, planetary based super cannons and big tetrahedral battleships, the non-capped games have all the senior players and they won't contain many fake accounts.<br>" +
    'And lastly I plan to sell skins for ships and other ingame objects, but only representative things that do not affect the balance in any way...</p>',
