# Empires in Space

* play with friend without needing them to be online
* compete with human beings: all other realms are player controlled (and not AI)
* "Pure free to play" : there is no pay to win and never will be
* strategic cooperation with friends â€“ defend (or expand) the borders of your realms together

[Empires in Space](http://www.empiresinspace.com/) is a civilization-like game, implemented as being a massive multiplayer title.
The game targets players who want a multiplayer 4X strategy game, without the need to be online at the same time, and thus without the need to arrange a hours lasting multiplayer match. Also it is balanced so that the player may spend just a few minutes per day to keep his empire running.
