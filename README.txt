The repository contains the basic rules of Empires in Space, and all label files.
You can do changes in the text files, or install a MS SQL Server Express and run the scripts in the server. 
This may be helpful to detect faulty cross references (for example referencing a buildingId in the "building productions" table, when the id does not exist in the "buildings" table).



If someone is interested in it, I could also upload the C# solution to create the starmap and solar systems, and the solution that I used to create the planet surfaces. The latter one uses an adaption of the perlin noise algorithm. Please inform me via my email adresse - I will then clean up the solutions so that they are a good base for enhancements of the community.
